Great question. The **settings area** should focus on **personalization & control** for your learners.
Here’s what typically works well in an **e-learning app** like yours:

---

## **Core Settings to Include**

1. **Profile & Account**

   * Change profile picture
   * Update name & email
   * Password change/reset (if you’re handling auth)
   * Linked accounts (Google, GitHub if relevant)

2. **Theme & Appearance**

   * Light / Dark mode toggle (you already have this logic)
   * Font size adjustment (for accessibility)
   * Layout options (compact vs normal spacing)

3. **Video & Learning Preferences**

   * **Autoplay next lesson** (on/off)
   * **Video quality preference** (Auto, 480p, 720p)
   * **Subtitle settings** (on/off, language)
   * **Default playback speed** (1x, 1.25x, etc.)

4. **Notifications**

   * Email notifications (new course recommendations, progress updates)
   * Push notifications (if mobile or PWA)

5. **Privacy & Security**

   * Manage devices
   * 2FA toggle (future)
   * Clear watch history (optional)

6. **App Information**
